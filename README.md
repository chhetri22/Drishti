## Inspiration
Drishti app is peculiarly developed for the blind and low vision community.To understand the need of our end users, the team studied and empathized with them rather than b digging into the financial problems faced by the blind and low vision community in the first place. 

After interviewing more than 50 visually impaired individuals, we found that they are already using some cash recognizing apps but are not satisfied with them. Some interviewees also shed light on their daily difficulties while traveling. They have suggested to include some additional features of location tracking and user friendly GPS in our future iterations.Our basic goal is to make a robust application which could benefit them.
